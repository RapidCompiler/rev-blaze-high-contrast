# Rev Blaze High Contrast

Rev Blaze is a Visual Studio Code colour theme in high contrast that has been consciously developed to aid developers with Deuteranopia colour vision deficiency.

Constant inputs from the visually impaired were taken into account during the development of this colour theme extension.
